     <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <h4>Lets visit the <em><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/">http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931</a></em> link</h4> 
   <p><strong>Website:</strong></p>
      <br>
      <img src="./website.png" alt="Website">
      <br>
      <p>
        As you can see, there are two buttons labelled, one  as “choose red” and the other “choose blue”. 
        On clicking these buttons the background color of the website changes to match the button label.
      </p>
    <h4>Lets inspect the website!</h4>
    <img src="./websiteInspection.png" alt="inspect website">
    <br>
    <p>Here in the “form” tag we can see two HTTP requests are being made in order to change the background color of the website. GET HTTP request for ‘Red’ background  and ‘POST’ HTTP request for ‘Blue’ background.
      As our <em>hint 1</em> suggests <strong>“we may have more than two choices”</strong> so let's look at different HTTP requests.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>PUT   : </strong>The <strong>PUT </strong>method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>DELETE : </strong>The <strong>DELETE</strong>  method deletes the specified resource
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>CONNECT :</strong> The <strong>CONNECT</strong> establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>OPTIONS :</strong> The <strong>OPTIONS</strong> method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>TRACE :</strong> The <strong>TRACE</strong> method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>HEAD :</strong> The <strong>HEAD</strong> method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body.
    </p>
      <h4>Let's look at our second hint</h4>
      
      <p>It tells us to checkout <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload" rel="noopeners" target="_blank">Burpsuite tool</a>. Burpsuite can be used to intercept and modify the web request.</p>
      <p>
        Here we can do two things: first we can use the hit and trial method and try out every HTTP request mentioned above.
        Second thing is that, if we read the challenge name carefully you will get the idea which method to use.
        As our  challenge name is <em>“GET aHead”</em> we will be using <em>“HEAD”</em> HTTP request
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>As you can see in the  above image that when we made a HEAD request we got our flag in the response
